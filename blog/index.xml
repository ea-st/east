      <description>What is a &amp;ldquo;Tiling window manager&amp;rdquo;? A tiling window manager is a window manager that organizes windows in a non-overlapping grid layout based on the amount of free space on your screen.&#xA;This differs from the more common stacking window manager most are accustomed to which usually has overlapping windows you move manually.&#xA;Advantages Productivity While it definitely is dependent on the user, for me it&amp;rsquo;s quicker to manage applications using keybinds.</description>

      <description>Introduction. What I mean by &amp;lsquo;digital ownership&amp;rsquo; is the online purchasing of media or subscriptions through platforms like&#xA;Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and Hulu. Spotify, SoundCloud, and Apple Music. Steam, Epic Games Store, and EA. The Problem. You do not own what you purchase.&#xA;When purchased digitally the consumer is paying to lease media which expires whenever the company you purchased it through feels like it.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s a serious issue when media purchased is out of the control of the user and is unable to be used offline without the need to sign into any account.</description>
