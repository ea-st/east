      <description>Introduction.

Spotify, SoundCloud, and Apple Music. Steam, Epic Games Store, and EA. The Problem. You do not own what you purchase.&#xA;When purchased digitally the consumer is paying to lease media which expires whenever the company you purchased it through feels like it.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s a serious issue when media purchased is out of the control of the user and is unable to be used offline without the need to sign into any account.</description>
